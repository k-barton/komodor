Using Komodo Edit as R GUI
======

**Komodo Edit** is a free multi-language code editor, based on the Mozilla platform. 
It uses an add-on (also called *extensions*) system similar to that of Firefox.
The extension **"R Interface"** provides Komodo with R GUI.

See [here](README.md) to learn about Komodo's "R Interface" features.

__Step 1: Install Komodo Edit from:__

<https://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit>

Users of Windows 7 with classic interface might prefer Komodo 9, which uses a 
system color theme and is somewhat faster, despite a few quirks. Older versions 
can be downloaded from <http://downloads.activestate.com/Komodo/releases/>

Useful settings at first use:

- show menubar (right-click \[or left-click for the right-handed\] on top toolbar to 
  show menu).
  
  
__Step 2. Install "R Interface" add-on.__

* Access **Add ons** using `<Ctrl+Shift+O>` or **Menu: Tools->Add-ons**, then 
navigate to **Add-ons->Packages->Languages->R interface**.

* Double click the item or press <Enter> and choose "Install".

The default keyboard shortcut for executing R code (current line or selected 
text) is `<Ctrl+Shift+R>`. However, if you are used to e.g. RStudio's 
`<Ctrl+Enter>`, the keyboard shortcuts can be customized under 
**Edit->Preferences->Keybindings**. R-related commands 
are prefixed with "R:".
